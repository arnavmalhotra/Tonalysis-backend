# Twelvelabs Integration - Final Solution

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Package Import Issue (SOLVED)
**Problem**: `pydantic_core` import error preventing Twelvelabs SDK from loading.

**Solution**: Updated `main.py` to include the correct Python path:
```python
import sys
# Add user site-packages to Python path
sys.path.insert(0, '/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages')
```

### 2. ⚠️ API Key Issue (NEEDS YOUR ACTION)
**Problem**: The `.env` file being read contains placeholder values instead of real API keys.

**What you need to do**:
1. **Replace the placeholder key** in your `.env` file with your actual Twelvelabs API key
2. Your real API key should start with `tlk_` followed by letters and numbers
3. Update this line in `.env`:
   ```
   TWELVELABS_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
   ```

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling (ADDED)
Added comprehensive error detection and helpful messages in `main.py`.

## Current Status

✅ **Twelvelabs SDK imports successfully**  
✅ **Package dependencies resolved**  
✅ **Enhanced error handling added**  
⚠️ **API key needs to be updated with real value**

## Next Steps

1. **Update your `.env` file** with the real Twelvelabs API key
2. **Test the connection** by running your FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
3. **Look for these messages** when the server starts:
   - ✅ `Twelvelabs SDK imported successfully`
   - ✅ `Twelvelabs client initialized successfully with key: tlk_...`

## If Still Getting "Failed connection"

The "Failed connection" error should be resolved now that we've:
1. Fixed the package import issues
2. Added proper Python path configuration
3. Enhanced error handling

If you still get connection errors after updating the API key:

1. **Check the server startup messages** - they will now clearly indicate if the issue is:
   - API key authentication
   - Network connectivity  
   - Package import problems

2. **Run the diagnostic script**:
   ```bash
   python3 quick_debug.py
   ```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `main.py` - Added Python path fix and enhanced error handling
- ✅ `quick_debug.py` - Created diagnostic tool
- ⚠️ `.env` - **YOU NEED TO UPDATE** with real API key

## What Should Happen Now

When you start your server with the real API key, you should see:
```
✅ Twelvelabs SDK imported successfully
✅ Twelvelabs client initialized successfully with key: tlk_1234567...
```

Instead of:
```
❌ Warning: TWELVELABS_API_KEY appears to be a placeholder!
```

The "Failed connection" error during video upload should be resolved once the real API key is in place.
